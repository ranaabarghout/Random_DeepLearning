# Random Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to the Random Deep Learning Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of diverse deep learning projects covering various topics and applications from the MIE1517 course (all credit goes to Professor Sinisa Colic for providing some of these notebooks and data). Each project is organized into separate folders for clarity and ease of navigation. Feel free to explore the projects and dive into the details of each one.
